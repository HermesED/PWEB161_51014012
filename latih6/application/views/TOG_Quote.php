		1. Stars, thrones, skies, the Outside World, I don't need any of those things.<br>
		But if someone tries to hurt someone precious to me, I will fight.<br>
		<br>
		2. If Rachel isn't up there, that place is nothing more than a pile of garbage.<br>
		No matter what's up there, that won't change. You told me that being like I am is strange,<br>
		but to me, you're a person who can't even find a single thing that's precious<br>
		within that huge pile of garbage.

		<br>
		2.You were alive...!! You were really alive....!! The black turtle is alive...!!<br>
		I won't let you go... I won't forgive.. those who made you like this... I won't forgive them!!<br>
